        <p>Cheese boards have always been in style. 

But for Sarah Gim, a Los Angeles-based food blogger behind the colorful Instagram account and blog, "The Delicious Life," the classic charcuterie board is a blank canvas that can always benefit from a creative twist. 

Gim told Insider that in her mind, everything is better with french fries. In July 2019, when she was asked to do a sponsored post involving frozen french fries, she developed the concept of the "fry board."

"Things have gone way beyond just cheese and charcuterie," Gim said. "You can really put anything on your board that's inspiring at the time."
