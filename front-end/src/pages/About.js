            <h1> I will never forget the first time I got to crunch down on the golden fried potato - yes, it is that serious! 

French fries or simply fries (North America) have had a renaissance of sorts in recent years - with people seemingly making their food ordering decision based on whether or not the restaurant has fries!  

With so many fries to enjoy worldwide, I was motivated to help people connect to the best restaurants with fries. Fry-Days is a place for both the  casual and the extream french fry lovers to find and favorite the best french fry spots around the world! 

Thank God it is Fry-Days!
